        <h1>Travel to London</h1>
        <h2> Things to see:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="location">Big Ben
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Clock_Tower_-_Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_May_2007.jpg/240px-Clock_Tower_-_Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_May_2007.jpg"> <p> Big Ben is one of London's most <em>historic</em> sites. Contrary to popular belief, it is <strong>not</strong> the name of the clock tower itself, but of the bell inside it. It weighs 13 and a half tons and was the biggest bell in the UK for 23 years.</p></li>
            <li class="location"> The London Eye
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/London-Eye-2009.JPG/240px-London-Eye-2009.JPG">
            <p> The London Eye is a giant Ferriis wheel in London. It's 135 meters tall and gives you a <strong>great</strong> view of the city. Tourisis will definitely want to check this out.</p></li>
            <li class="location"> Piccadilly Circus <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Open_Happiness_Piccadilly_Circus_Blue-Pink_Hour_120917-1126-jikatu.jpg/220px-Open_Happiness_Piccadilly_Circus_Blue-Pink_Hour_120917-1126-jikatu.jpg">
            <p> Picadilly Circus is basically London's equivalent of Times Square. A lot of major shopping areas are located within it. The most <em>notable</em> thing about its appearance is the giant billboards on the side of a building. If you want to get some shopping done in London, this is the place to go.</p></li>
